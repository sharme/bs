Modernizr is a feature detection that work with CSS and Javascript.


Modernizr.mq
Modernizr.mq(mq)

Modernizr.mq allows for you to programmatically check if the current browser window state matches a media query.

 var query = Modernizr.mq('(min-width: 900px)');
 if (query) {
   // the browser window is larger than 900px
 }
Only valid media queries are supported, therefore you must always include values with your media query

// good
 Modernizr.mq('(min-width: 900px)');
// bad
 Modernizr.mq('min-width');
